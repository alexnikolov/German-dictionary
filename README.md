# German dictionary

This project is aimed to help people keep track of words they have encountered while learning German.   

The dictionary supports adding, editing, viewing and deleting nouns, verbs and adjectives, as well as viewing words that share a common meaning.   

Users can also engage in an interactive quiz mode where they can test their knowledge on encountered words in three different quiz modes:  
  - *Quiz meaning* - test your knowledge on the meaning of all added words  
  - *Quiz nouns* - test your knowledge on the gender and plural form of all added nouns  
  - *Quiz verbs* - test your knowledge on the forms of all added verbs  

GUI and CLI interfaces are planned.
